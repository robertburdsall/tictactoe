<h1>TicTacToe!</h1>

<h3>I programmed tictactoe for a class that I am currently taking at my school. This project is nothing special and doesn't implement anything super cool, but it was a useful way for me to learn Java and served as my first real into to JavaFX!</h3>

<h3>In addition to normal tictactoe, the main functionality added here (besides the back and reset buttons) is the ability to add a photo from your computer and use it in place of X and O.</h3>

<h4>The GUI for this project was originally created by a teacher at my school named Brian Sea, but I edited it as I explored adding a leaderboard and implementing adding photos to the game. Some elements of the game may be his, but I doubt he cares. He has credit throughout the different files that have his name in the headers.</h4>
